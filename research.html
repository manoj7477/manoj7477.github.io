                        <h3><strong>Harnessing Immune Intelligence to Outsmart Viral Evolution</strong></h3>
                        <p>I am expressing my sincere interest in the fields of Virology and Immunology. I recently graduated with a Master’s degree from India, during which I completed my thesis titled “Elucidation of POTE (Prostate, Ovary, Testis, and Embryo) Protein Expression” at AIIMS, India. My research involved both in silico and in vitro approaches to study ovarian cancer, focusing on the impact of DAPT and VPA on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and POTEE expression in ovarian cancer patients.</p>
                        <p>Currently, under the same affiliation, I am working as a Junior Researcher on a project entitled “A Population-based Prospective Cohort Study to Unravel the Causes of Stroke and Cognitive Decline and Immune Cell Distribution.” In addition, I am contributing remotely as a Research Intern to the Macrophage Lung Microbiota project at the University of Bern, DBMR, Switzerland. My role involves conducting statistical analyses to develop a physiologically relevant human lung macrophage model that highlights the differential innate immune landscape influenced by lung microbiota.</p>
                        <p>I am capable of independently conducting experiments, including those involving mouse models, flow cytometry, histology, and light microscopy. I have strong expertise in isolating PBMCs, working with animal models, and performing ELISA. I am also skilled in isolating and culturing murine intestinal microbes. My technical abilities extend to basic cell culture, fluorescence microscopy, cytochemistry, and gene/protein expression analysis.</p>
                        <p>Currently, I am learning R programming and transcriptomics analysis to enhance my bioinformatics skills. My dedication and leadership have been recognized by the American Society for Microbiology, which honored me as a fellow. Additionally, my Master’s work was selected for the “Bharat Gaurav Puraskar,” awarded by the KIK Foundation.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I have demonstrated leadership and organizational abilities as the founder of the non-governmental organization “JUST ONE STEP FOUNDATION” in India. Through this initiative, we are actively engaged in impactful projects across eight states, showcasing my commitment to driving meaningful change.</p>

                            <h2>Isolation and production of liquid nitrogen fixer biofertilizer and growth effects on chickpea (cicer arietinum)</h2>
                            <p class="research-description">The aim of present study was the production of liquid nitrogen fixer biofertilizer using selective and optimized media. Nitrogen containing products which helps to increase germination rate, increase production rate with growth of plants. Field inoculation of plants with Azotobacter and Rhizobium after cultivation of experimental plants it is noted that 20-40 kg nitrogen remain back which benefits for further plantation and reduce use of 25% chemical fertilizers. Due to the function of Azotobacter and Rhizobium in nitrogen fixation and to their probable biotechnological applications, there are few challenges in developing an effectual approach for the selective isolation of these microorganisms from soil. During this study experimental plants of chickpea Cicer arietinum shows that the growth of plant is better than normal growth and it increase yields.</p>

                            <h2>Deep learning in clinical genomics-based cancer diagnosis</h2>
                            <p class="research-description">Deep learning, an artificial intelligence facet, has impacted distinct fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. Its advancements have transformed how computational and data scientists approach data, turning unstructured information into valuable insights. This is particularly impactful in clinical genomics, where high-throughput sequencing generates vast amounts of data. Techniques such as whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic profiling produce enormous datasets that are challenging to analyze manually. Deep learning tools like “Deep Variant” enhance accuracy in variant calling, improving diagnostic precision. By adapting to factors such as genetic mutations and disease progression, deep learning aids in early cancer diagnosis and better clinical outcomes. This chapter explores these transformative applications in clinical genomic research.</p>
